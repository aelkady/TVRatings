# TVRatings

Inspired by graphtv.kevinformatics.com, it is an app that graphs IMDB ratings of shows. Right now the home screen is simply a search bar which goes to a page with a scatter plot of the rankings, with show information visible below and episode information visible as you click on the graph's data points.

# Features that will be coming soon:

- Zoom in on graph. Particularly critical for shows with a lot of episodes
- Better UI for the home page. Will include sidebar and possibly ways to view the IMDB pages of the shows themselves
- Caching popular TV shows + common/recent searches

And much more!
